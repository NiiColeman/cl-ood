## Comparative Analysis

1. Overall Performance:
   - Learned Coefficients method shows significant improvement across all datasets, now highly competitive with TIES and DARE_TIES.
   - It consistently outperforms Linear and SVD across all datasets by a large margin.

2. Dataset-Specific Performance:
   - PACS: Learned Coefficients (82.95% avg) outperforms all other methods, including TIES (80.55%).
   - VLCS: Learned Coefficients (80.25% avg) is very close to TIES (81.20%) and outperforms other methods.
   - SVIRO: Learned Coefficients (84.09% avg) shows dramatic improvement, now much closer to TIES (92.30%) and DARE_TIES (92.90%).
   - OfficeHome: Learned Coefficients (79.88% avg) is competitive with DARE_TIES (79.50%) and close to TIES (82.50%).

3. Consistency Across Domains:
   - Learned Coefficients shows excellent consistency across all datasets, with the lowest or near-lowest standard deviations in each dataset.
   - Particularly notable in SVIRO, where it now has a lower standard deviation (8.66%) than TIES (6.52%) and DARE_TIES (3.96%).
